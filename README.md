Welcome to the depths of the tunnels. Here is the coin that will change the way that gremlins and critters interact with one another in a tunnel of harmony. Listen to the wispers and jump into the ether with both feet. We will be tourists together.

Gremcoin - it's a Scrypt Proof of Work and Proof of Stake blockchain device that runs on the "blood chain". 
Gremcoin - to start there are 69 GREM in a block, it has a limited supply with halvenings and all that pizazz.
Gremcoin - Right now there is a windows and linux compiled wallet. Might build for mac but there tends to be bigger grems to fry.
